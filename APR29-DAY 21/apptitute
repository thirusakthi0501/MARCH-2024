Three pipes A, B and C can fill a tank from empty to full in 30 minutes, 20 minutes, and 10 minutes respectively.
When the tank is empty, all the three pipes are opened. A, B and C discharge chemical solutions P,Q and R respectively. 
What is the proportion of the solution R in the liquid in the tank after 3 minutes?
A) 5/11
B) 7/11
C) 6/11
D) 8/11

sol
A+B+C in 3 min  =3(1/30+1/20+1/10)
                =(3×1/60)=(11/20)
Part filled by C in 3 minutes = (3/2010)
ratio=(3/10×20/11) 
6/11

A tank is filled by three pipes with uniform flow. 
The first two pipes operating simultaneously fill the tank in the same time during which the tank is filled by the third pipe alone.
The second pipe fills the tank 5 hours faster than the first pipe and 4 hours slower than the third pipe. Time required by the first pipe to fill the tank is
A) 6 hours
B) 15 hours
C) 10 hours
D) 30 hours

sol
1/A+1/(A-5)=1/(A-9)
1/15+1/10=1/6
1/6=1/6

hence 15 hrs
