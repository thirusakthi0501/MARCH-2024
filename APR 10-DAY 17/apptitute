1.Two pipes A and B can fill a cistern in 37 minutes and 45 minutes respectively. Both pipes are opened. 
  The cistern will be filled in just half an hour, if the B is turned off after:

    5 min.
    9 min.
   10 min.
   15 min.
sol

          A = 1/37
          B= 1/45
          A's 30  = 30/37
         Rem work = 1- 30/37 = 7/37
         = 45 * 7/37 
         = 8.5 ~ 9

2.Two outlet pipes A and B are connected to a full tank. Pipe A alone can empty the tank in 10 minutes and pipe B alone can empty the tank in 30 minutes. 
  If both are opened together, how much time will it take to empty the tank completely?

7 minutes
7 minutes 30 seconds
6 minutes
6 minutes 3 seconds

    Sol
          A = 1/10
          B= 1/30
          A + B = 1/10 + 1/30 = 4/30
          30/4 = 7.5
7 minutes 30 seconds
