M did a piece of work in 5 days. That piece of work was done by N in 9 days. If M and N worked together, they got total wages of Rs 4200. Find the share of N.

A) 1500
B) 2000
C) 1000
D) 1200
E) None of these

      Sol
          LCM of 5 and 9 = 45 
          N= 5/14 * 4200 = 1500

      

A can do a piece of work in 9 days and B in 18 days. They begin together, but A goes away three days before the work is finished. The work lasts for
a) 6 Days
b) 8 Days
c) 12 Days
d) 10 Days
e) 3 Days

      Sol
          LCM  9 ,18 = 18 
          Aeff = 2
          Beff= 1
          B's 3 work = 3
           rwork = 15 -> 15/3 = 5
          Work completed in 5 + 3 = 8
