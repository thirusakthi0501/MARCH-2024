1. - A funnel can fill a tank in 15 hours .because of a hole in the bottom; it is filled in 20 hours. 
     On the off chance that the tank is full, what amount of the reality of the situation will become obvious eventually break take to discharge it?
A - 40 hours
B - 50 hours
C - 60 hours
D - 70 hours

Sol
      1/15 + 1/x = 1/20
      1/x = 3-4 /60
      1/x = 1/60


2.Two funnels can fill a reservoir in 14 hours and 16 hours individually. 
  The channels are opened all the while and it is found that because of spillage in the base it took 32 minutes more to fill the reservoir. 
  Once the reservoir is full, in what time, spillage will discharge the full reservoir?
A - 5 hr
B - 8 hr
C - 9 hr
D - 10 hr

Sol
      1/14 + 1/16 = 15/112 = 7 hrs 28 mins
      due to leak = 8 hrs
      15/112 + 1/X = 1/8
      1/x = 1/8 - 15/112
      1/X = 14 - 15/112
      1/x = 1/112

 8 hrs
